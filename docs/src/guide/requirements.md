# System requirements

NativeLib supports Windows, MacOSX and Linux. Internally it uses python so you should have it before installation.

For Windows: just install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

Usually MacOSes have preinstalled python 2.7.x. NativeLib-CLI tested with this python version and it should work. But if you have some strange errors you can try to install Python 3 using [Mac Ports](https://www.macports.org) or [Home brew](https://brew.sh). With it NativeLib works more stable.

For Linux: install python 3 (if it's not installed yet). Also check if right version of python is available in your $PATH.
